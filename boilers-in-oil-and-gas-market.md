<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boilers in Oil and Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Tube Boilers</li><li>Fire Tube Boilers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Boilers in the oil and gas market are crucial for steam generation and process heating. Water tube boilers use water-filled tubes to absorb heat from combustion gases, offering high efficiency and low water volume, suitable for high-pressure applications. Fire tube boilers, on the other hand, contain hot gases flowing through tubes surrounded by water, making them simpler and more cost-effective for lower pressure applications. Both types serve critical roles in energy production and industrial processes, with distinct advantages based on operational needs.</p></p>
