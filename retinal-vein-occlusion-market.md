<p><p>Retinal Vein Occlusion (RVO) is a common vascular disorder of the retina characterized by the blockage of the retinal veins, leading to vision loss and other complications. It occurs primarily due to underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, which cause damage to the blood vessels in the eye. RVO is categorized into two main types: central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) and branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The market for RVO therapies is witnessing significant growth, driven by an increase in the prevalence of risk factors such as aging populations, rising incidences of diabetes and hypertension, and advancements in treatment options.</p><p>Emerging trends in the Retinal Vein Occlusion market include the development of innovative therapeutic agents, including anti-VEGF therapies and corticosteroids, alongside the exploration of gene therapies. Additionally, there is a growing focus on improving patient outcomes through combination therapies and novel delivery mechanisms. The Retinal Vein Occlusion Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10% during the forecast period, driven by an expanding patient population and the increasing adoption of advanced healthcare technologies. These factors are likely to enhance market dynamics and expand treatment accessibility.</p></p>
