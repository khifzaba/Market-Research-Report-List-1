<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) management market encompasses two primary types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are devices designed to divert excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to another area of the body, alleviating pressure and preventing complications from conditions like hydrocephalus. On the other hand, CSF drainage systems involve the temporary removal of CSF, often for diagnostic purposes or to relieve pressure. Both types are critical in managing neurological disorders and ensuring patient safety.</p></p>
